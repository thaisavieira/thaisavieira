<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Thaísa Vieira</h1>      
I was a Physics student (bachelor's and licentiate's degree) at UNESP in Rio Claro, but I had to interrupt my studies due to the pandemic.  Currently, I am studying Computer Science using the <a href = "https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"> OSSU (Open Source Society University) </a> and <a href = "https://github.com/Universidade-Livre"> UBL (Universidade Brasileira Livre)</a> programs. Unfortunately, these courses don't offer a formal diploma, so I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at Descomplica EAD University (2023-2025). As a self-taught student, I use several tools that help me build/reinforce my knowledge, as example to exercise my skills I like to practice logic on websites like CodeWars, where I have Python as my main language. Also, I dabble in JavaScript, C#, and .NET, and, sometimes, to satisfy my nostalgia from college, I do some things in Fortran. I also use websites like Frontend Mentor and DevChallenges to exercise/develop my front-end skills. As a hobby, I write for platforms like DEV Community, where I'm a moderator, and, also on Coder Legion, where I'm a guest writer.

I'm like to mention that I'm looking for my first opportunity.
