# Ol√°, eu sou Tha√≠sa Vieira! üëã
I was a Physics student (bachelor's and licentiate's degree) at UNESP in Rio Claro, but I had to interrupt my studies due to the pandemic. Fortunately, I maintained my curiosity and desire always to continue to learn.
Currently, I am studying Computer Science using the![OSSU](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/) (Open Source Society University) and [![UBL](https://ulivre.dev/)] (Universidade Brasileira Livre) programs. Unfortunately, these courses don't offer a formal diploma, so I am studying Systems Analysis and Development at Descomplica EAD university(2023-2025).
As a self-taught student, I use several tools that help me build/reinforce my knowledge, as example to exercise my skills I like to practice logic on websites like CodeWars, where I have Python as my main language. Also, I dabble in JavaScript, C#, .NET, and, sometimes, to satisfy my nostalgia from college, some things in Fortran. I also use websites like Frontend Mentor and DevChallenges to exercise/develop my front-end skills.
As a hobby, I write for platforms like DEV Community, where I'm a moderator, and, also on Coder Legion, where I'm a guest writer. As well I also actively participate in communities on Discord, which for me works like a classroom.

I'm looking for my first opportunity!
