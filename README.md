<h1 align="center">Hello there, I'm Thaísa Vieira</h1>
<h3 align="center">Systems Analysis & Development Student | Python Enthusiast | Lifelong Learner</h3>
<p>Passionate about science, technology, and problem-solving. Currently exploring different areas in software development through Python projects, academic studies, and open-source learning.
I began my academic career with a bachelor's degree in Physics from UNESP, where I developed logical and analytical thinking. During this period, I worked with tools such as MATLAB, solved linear algebra problems using Fortran, and wrote technical reports with LaTeX based on laboratory experiments. 
Today, I am a Systems Analysis and Development student at <a href = 'https://www.fatecsorocaba.edu.br/'>Fatec Sorocaba</a>, complementing my education through open learning initiatives like <a href = "https://github.com/ossu/computer-science"> OSSU (Open Source Society University) </a> and <a href = "https://github.com/Universidade-Livre"> UBL (Universidade Brasileira Livre)</a>, as well as platforms such as Code Wars, Roadmap.sh, and Kaggle.
I actively participate in tech communities as a moderator at DEV Community and a guest writer at Code Legion, while also practicing my skills by answering questions on Stack Overflow.

Obs.: The cover image features Hypatia of Alexandria, the first woman documented as a mathematician in history, who lived for science and died for ignorance. One of the historical figures that I greatly admire and bring as inspiration.
